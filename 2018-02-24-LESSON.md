# Add Router, Add Views, Add Controllers, Add Partials
My notes, sorta messy

## Routing

Without doing anything extra normal routing will work like this when visiting a web site.
```
http://localhost:8080/index.php
http://localhost:8080/about.php
http://localhost:8080/contact.php
```
Each of these are individual files. For smaller sites this works ok, but it can get out of hand quickly if you have anything larger.

So when you need more flexibility you can setup a router. This will enable urls like so:
```
http://localhost:8080/
http://localhost:8080/about
http://localhost:8080/contact
```
They all route back through the `index.php` file.

Behind the scenes it looks to see if the URL you are providing exists as a directory or a file, if it doesn't we will tell the server 'default back to index.php' but it keeps the URL so we can read it and do something with it.
```
http://localhost:8080/about
But this doesn't exist so we keep the above url, but load:
http://localhost:8080/index.php
Routing will handle the rest.
```

### Changes needed for Routing

Lets start separating our files correctly. First lets create a `views` directory. We can move our about.php, contact.php in and rename them, also create a index.view.php. We will move the HTML inside `/index.php` to `/views/index.php`

If we look at our index.php file it's handling the entry point of our app but it's also handling the view. So lets separate that out. Lets create a `controllers` directory. Add a controller for each view.

Add the views to each files:
```php
// inside about.php
require 'about.view.php';
```

Before we go any farther we need to make some adjustments inside vagrant for this to work.

Install mod_rewrite for apache2, inside vagrant:
```bash
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

We need to allow `.htaccess` files in our web root.
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    <Directory /var/www/html>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    . . .
</VirtualHost>
```
```bash
# add the information above to this file
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Create `.htaccess` inside `/var/www/html`:
```
Options +FollowSymLinks
RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
```

We now can start working on our router. We need to define some routes. Inside index.php lets figure out what it might look like:
```php
$routes = [
  '' => 'controllers/index.php',
  'about' => 'controllers/about.php',
  'contact' => 'controllers/contact.php'
]
```

This will take the uri and correctly load the controller to either get something from the database or other functionally then send that to a view. This is the basics of what is MVC (Model, View Controller).

Next we need to create a router to do something with this information. Lets create a `router.php` inside core.

```php
class Router
{
  protected $routes = [];

  public function define($routes)
  {
    $this->routes = $routes;
  }
}
```

And this stuff should really not be in the index.php so lets give it, its own file. `routes.php`; We will make a slice change but move the routes from index.php to routes.php:

```php
$router->define([
  '' => 'controllers/index.php',
  'about' => 'controllers/about.php',
  'contact' => 'controllers/contact.php'
]);
```

Lets add the new core/router to our bootstrap file:

```php
require 'core/router.php';
```

Now lets get it working in the main index.php file
```php
$router = new Router;

require 'routes.php';
```

Now we need to send the router which URI we are on, so it can work.

Add to router.php:
```php
...
public function direct($uri)
{
  if (array_key_exists($uri, $this->routes)) {
    return $this->routes[$uri];
  }

  throw new Exception('No route defined for this uri');
}
```
and finally in index.php we need to send it the correct URI:
```php
$uri = trim($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], '/');

require $router->direct($uri);
```
Now you can go to http://localhost:808/about
